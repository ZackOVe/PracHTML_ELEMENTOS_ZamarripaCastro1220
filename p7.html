  <h4>La historia dice asi: </h4>
  <p>In this farewell
    There's no blood, there's no alibi
    'Cause I've drawn regret
    From the truth of a thousand lies
    So let mercy come and wash away
    What I've done
    I'll face myself
    To cross out what I've become
    Erase myself
    And let go of what I've done
    Put to rest
    What you thought of me
    While I clean this slate
    With the hands of uncertainty
    So let mercy come and wash away
    What I've done
    I'll face myself
    To cross out what I've become
    Erase myself
    And let go of what I've done
    For what I've done
    I start again
    And whatever pain may come
    Today this ends
    I'm forgiving
    What I've done
    I'll face myself
    To cross out what I've become
    Erase myself
    And let go of what I've done
    What I've done
    (Na-na, na, na, na-na, na, na)
    (Na-na, na, na, na-na, na, na)
    Forgiving what I've done
    (Na-na, na, na, na-na, na, na)
    (Na-na, na, na, na-na, na)
